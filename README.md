# SBML2SHACL
 **SBML2SHACL** allows you to convert a SBML file in a RDF Turtle graph and verify it through SHACL. 
 


 It is required the installation of the [rdflib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) python library.

## Project
### Model
That folder contains
- The [shapes' definition](project/model/shapes.ttl) file modeling SBML constructs.

- A [diagram](project/model/diagram.png) showing modeled constructs and their relations.

- A SHACL [verifier](project/model/shacl_verifier.py) for Turtle graphs. 

Are modeled whole [SBML Extended](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/50975/1/sbml-comp-version-1-release-3.pdf) and a subset of [SBML 3.2](co.mbine.org/specifications/sbml.level-3.version-2.core.release-2.pdf) constructs. 

### Parsers
It is implied that input SBML files are correct, reconversion from Turtle to XML won't necessarily output a file identical to the input SBML model but it will be the same knowledge (with respect to the modeled constructs).

[ttl2sbml.py](project/parsers/ttl2sbml.py) does **NOT** convert **ANY** Turtle file to SBML.

## Test

### Models
Contains some models to work with the converter, models taken from [Biomodels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) are all SBML 3.2 files while in [custom](project/test/models/custom) there are examples taken from the SBML Extended specification and dummy URIs are used, hence they won't pass [SBML validator's](http://sbml.org/Facilities/Validator).

### Example
Here can be seen an example of execution, the files in that folder are generated by the following commands.
```
$ python ./project/parsers/sbml2ttl.py -f ./test/example/example.xml -o ./test/example/sbml2ttl.ttl 
$ python ./project/model/shacl_verifier.py -s ./project/model/shapes.ttl -d ./test/example/sbml2ttl.ttl
True
Validation Report
Conforms: True

$ python ./project/parsers/ttl2sbml.py -f ./test/example/sbml2ttl.ttl -o ./test/example/ttl2sbml.xml 
```
